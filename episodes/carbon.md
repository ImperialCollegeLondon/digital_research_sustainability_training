:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions

- What is energy?
- What is power?
- How power and energy relate to carbon emissions?
- What other sources of carbon involve digital research?
- How do we calculate carbon emissions?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Explain what energy and power are
- Explain how energy is produced
- Explain what low-carbon energy sources are and how they opperate
- Explain what embeded carbon is
- Use the greenhouse gas (GHG) protocol to estimate carbon emissions

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

(This episode will be heavy on pointing to the [Green software practitioner course] sections)

## Energy and power

TBC

## Energy sources and carbon emissions

(Can we embed plots from [National Grid: Live] here?
Or point people to the [Online MUSE calculator])

TBC

## Embedded carbon and carbon awareness

TBC

## The greenhouse gass (GHG) protocol and how to use it

TBC

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

## According to the GHG protocol, what are the carbon emissions of...?

- Using a laptop in the office for coding 4h a day, 5 days a week. No calculations run.
- Brewing 5 cups of coffee per day, at home, 5 days a week.

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

## Output

No idea. We need to do it.
